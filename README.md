# AMQ-7TV-Chat
Tapermonkey script for using 7TV emotes in the AMQ (Anime Music Quiz) chat. I might add more functionality in the future, but this works well enough.

# How to install
1. Have tapermonkey or some extension that can run the script (not sure if anything other than tapermonkey works).
2. Click [here](https://github.com/Sheppsu/AMQ-7TV-Chat/raw/main/script.user.js) and tapermonkey should prompt you to install it. If no prompt appears, you can either copy paste the code into a new script or use import from URL under utilities on the tapermonkey dashboard.

# How to use
- Click the emote button on the bottom right of the AMQ chat to open up the emote container. You'll see an option to add/remove/clear 7TV emote sets.
  - To add an emote set, paste the emote set ID and click `Add`.
  - To remove an emote set, paste the emote set ID and click `Remove`.
  - To completely clear all emote sets, click `Clear`.
- You can find an emote set's ID by going to the emote set page and copying the ID from the URL. You can find emote sets on a user's 7TV profile and get to the page from there. You can get to another user's 7TV profile by searching them up with 7TV's user search functionality. Example: The ID of `https://7tv.app/emote-sets/610af345c5ccdd7baf4f6824` is `610af345c5ccdd7baf4f6824`.
